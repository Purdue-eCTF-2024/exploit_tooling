# Agenda

1. Finish of SMCAA (this should be easy, just leak their keys from the image dump)
2. Debug why MIT didn't work even when we got their keys (and hopefully first blood supply chain boot)
3. Dump and analyze post boot code
  - Dump the ap of some team to get post boot ap code
    - Both SMCAA and UCI have buffer overflows on the ap
    - write shellcode and exploit for this
  - Dump someones insulin sensor to get that post boot code
    - easy, already have tools for this, just hasn't been done yet
  - analyze post boot code
4. The UB rop chain to get pump swap
5. The UB rop chain to dump supply chain, hypothetically I think we can get a UB supply chain boot
6. Michigan State supply chain boot
  - This one is complicated by the fact we will need our malicous component to be on the same i2c address as the real component
7. The UIUC pump swap with dropped packets
  - Once we dump post boot code, we should know if this is possible or not
8. Hardware Hacking Stuff (glitch attack, etc.)
9. Submit Writeups
