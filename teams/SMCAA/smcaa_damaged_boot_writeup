We exploited a buffer overflow in the smcaa's ap send validate function, where it recieved from the i2c into a buffer only 16 bytes big. We had a malicious component that sent a 100 byte packet that overflowed the buffer, overwrote the return address, and jumped to some shellcode which dumped the entire ap's flash. We then used strings | grep 'ectf' to find the flag in the flash.
